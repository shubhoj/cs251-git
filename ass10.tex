This moive was directed by RajKumar Hirani. It is an awesome movies which depicts very aptly the life style of 3 indian students studying in a college.

\section{Movie 1: }
A great part of the film's appeal is Aamir Khan, who has come to specialize in heroic iconoclasts, such as a rebellious villager in "Lagaan" or a visionary teacher of special-needs kids in "Taare Zameen Par." As Rancho, a young engineer of dazzling inventiveness, Khan conveys smarts, mischief and, finally, compassion, as he spurs his friends on to greatness before he mysteriously disappears.

The film's good points, though, are marred by a slow start and a nerve-jangling soundtrack (except for the charming "Aal Izz Well"). Perceptive, subtle acting work by Khan, Madhavan and Joshi also clashes with buffoonish performances by Omi Vaidya, as an odious school rival, and veteran character actor Irani, whose character is cursed with an unnecessary -- and unfunny -- lisp.

Hirani's screenplay also jumps back and forth in time over a 10-year period with limited success, leaving the viewer often wondering whether we're seeing scenes set in the present or the past.

Despite its flaws, "3 Idiots" conveys a powerful message about how valuable your friends can be when they push you toward reaching your own highest potential.
